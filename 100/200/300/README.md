# 300 - Installing on Linux

[Download the DEB file or RPM file](https://ballerina.io/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution to ```/usr/lib64/ballerina```.

***Info***: Alternatively, you can use either of the below commands to install Ballerina using the downloaded DEB or RPM file. Replace the ```<ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.deb``` or ```<ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.rpm``` with the actual file path.

For the DEB file:

```dpkg -i <ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.deb ```

For the RPM file:

```rpm -i <ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.rpm ```
